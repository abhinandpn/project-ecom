An environment file, commonly known as ".env" file, is a configuration file used in software development to store specific variables and settings for different project environments. It allows developers to separate sensitive information, such as API keys and credentials, from the source code, promoting security and preventing accidental exposure. By utilizing an environment file, developers can easily switch between environments, collaborate more efficiently, and simplify the deployment process. This file serves as a central configuration mechanism, enhancing the maintainability, scalability, and portability of projects.
